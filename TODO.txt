Optimize merger tree reading routines:
1) Should include a "Header" in each merger tree file, at least saying how many
subhalos there are in the current file and how many there are in all files.
Once this is done, remove unnecessary code from "read_dataset_manyfiles" function.
2) When reading different quantities, try to open each file only once.

Optional:
- Modify code to use new halo catalogs, named "groups_NNN.X.hdf5"
