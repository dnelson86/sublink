To do:
- Should include a "Header" in each merger tree file, at least saying how many
subhalos there are in the current file and how many there are in all files.
Once this is done, optimize "read_dataset_manyfiles" function accordingly.

Optional:
- Modify code to use new halo catalogs, named "groups_NNN.X.hdf5"
